# PasswordGen

A CLI tool for generating passwords. My very first program so don't expect the code to be good, however it does work and can generate random passwords with/without the diceware technique. Has a built in "game" to help memorize your generated password & can save X amount of passwords to a file if desired.

## Updated Version

I've rewrote most of the functionality of this tool in Python to be used as a script. Link here: https://github.com/jarethill/pwgen
